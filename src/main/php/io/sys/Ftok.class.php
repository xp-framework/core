 * DESCRIPTION
 * The ftok() function returns a key based on path and id that is usable in 
 * subsequent calls to msgget(), semget() and shmget(). The path argument 
 * must be the pathname of an existing file that the process is able to 
 * stat().
 * 
 * The ftok() function will return the same key value for all paths that 
 * name the same file, when called with the same id value, and will return 
 * different key values when called with different id values or with paths 
 * that name different files existing on the same file system at the same 
 * time. It is unspecified whether ftok() returns the same key value when 
 * called again after the file named by path is removed and recreated with 
 * the same name.
