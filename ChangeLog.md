XP Framework Core ChangeLog
========================================================================

## ?.?.? / ????-??-??

### Heads up!

* **Remove variant of create() which returns object given**.
  See xp-framework/core#90
  (@thekid)
* **Removed deprecated raise() core functionality**.
  See xp-framework/core#89
  (@thekid)
* **Removed pre-namespace class loading**:
  - The deprecated `uses()` core functionality has been removed.
  - It is no longer possible to use package-qualified classes.
  - Using classes declared in the global namespace as fully-qualified is
    also no longer supported.
  See xp-framework/core#88
  (@thekid)

## 6.3.4 / 2015-06-25

### Heads up!

* **Dropped support for PHP7 alpha1, now requires alpha2!** This second
  alpha includes the "Throwable" RFC which changes the builtin exception
  hierarchy.
  (@thekid)

### Bugfixes

* Adopted to changes in PHP7's exception hierarchy. See php/php-src#1284
  and https://wiki.php.net/rfc/throwable-interface
  (@thekid)
* Changed `lang.CommandLine`, `text.TextTokenizer`, `text.StreamTokenizer`
  and `io.streams.StringReader` to cope with a behaviour change to substr.
  See https://bugs.php.net/69931.
  (@thekid)
* Fixed bug with PHP7 when reading lines from the console
  (@thekid)
* Fixed bug with importing into global scope on HHVM
  (@thekid)

## 6.3.3 / 2015-06-24

* Fixed bug when using `uses()` with classes that have an __import method.
  (@johannes85)

## 6.3.2 / 2015-06-23

### Bugfixes

* Fixed forking server to handle *SIGTERM* correctly, which is what xpws
  sends when the user presses Enter.
  (@thekid)
* Fixed race condition inside `peer.server.PreforkingServer` which would
  prevent a clean shutdown
  (@thekid)
* Fixed `math.BigNum` division on HHVM cutting off below default precision
  (@thekid)

### Features

* Added `toString()` method to *BigNum* class (and thus BigInt and BigFloat)
  (@thekid)

## 6.3.1 / 2015-06-13

### Heads up!

* This release creates forward compatibility with PHP7. Please note the
  XP6 series will not support PHP7 officially: It reserves the name `object`,
  which clashes with our root class `lang.Object`.

  However, [PHP7 alpha 1](http://php.net/archive/2015.php#id2015-01-11-6)
  does [not yet raise an error](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/php-7.0.0alpha1/UPGRADING#L392)
  if this class name is used.

  Parts of the XP test suite do not pass on PHP7, as we still use other
  features incompatible with this new version. These are now in an extra
  unittest configuration file, *not-on-php-nightly.ini*. All other tests
  are expected to pass, and we're working on reducing the incompatible ones.
  (@thekid)

### Features

* Restored PHP7 forward compatibility by renaming internal *null* class
  to `__null`. See pull request xp-framework/core#86
  (@thekid)

### Bugfixes

* Fixed annotation parser to handle PHP7 eval() throwing exceptions instead
  of raising errors
  (@thekid)
* Fixed parity for PHP7 when handling undefined methods in PHP7, which
  now behaves like HHVM (!). See xp-framework/core#87
  (@thekid)
* Wrapped PHP7's `BaseException` inside a TargetInvocationException in
  method and constructor invocations
  (@thekid)

## 6.3.0 / 2015-06-02

### Heads up!

* Added a new `nameof()` core function aimed at replacing the getClassName()
  method and deprecated the \xp::nameOf() method.
  (@thekid)
* Deprecated wrapper types in `lang.types`, primitive boxing and unboxing.
  See xp-framework/core#84
  (@thekid)

### RFCs

* Implemented first part of xp-framework/rfc#297: Added new `lang.Value`
  interface and support for it throughout the framnework as a forward-
  compatibility measure. See xp-framework/core#85
  (@thekid)

### Bugfixes

* Fixed `unittest.actions.VerifyThat` not running static methods correctly
  (@thekid)

### Features

* Added util.Objects::compare() method which mimics PHP7's `<=>` operator
  including support for lang.Value::compareTo().
  (@thekid)
* Merged xp-framework/core#76: Implement type unions. Instead of using
  the `var` type on methods following the *be liberal in what you accept*
  rule and documenting what is accepted in the apidocs, the type system
  now allows for types such as `int|string`. This is widely used in PHP
  pseudo code, and may even end up in syntax if the union types RFC gets
  accepted: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/union_types
  (@thekid)

## 6.2.5 / 2015-05-25

### Heads up!

* Added class constants for Archive::open() and deprecated `ARCHIVE_*`.
  See xp-framework/core#80
  (@thekid)
* Added class constants for File::open() and deprecated `FILE_MODE_*`.
  See xp-framework/core#79
  (@thekid)
* Deprecated io.ZipFile class - use GzDecompressingInputStream instead!
  See xp-framework/core#78
  (@thekid)
* Deprecated io.SpoolDirectory class
  (@thekid)

### Features

* Merged xp-framework/core#83: New io.Path::real() shorthand
  (@thekid)
* Merged xp-framework/core#82: Path::asFile() and asFolder() prevent
  conditionals
  (@thekid)
* Merged xp-framework/core#81: Feature: Folder entries
  (@thekid)
* Changed io.Path::equals() to perform normalization before comparing
  (@thekid)
* Changed io.File::open() to return the file itself, enabling fluent API
  usage: `$f= (new File('test'))->open(File::READ);`.
  (@thekid)
* Changed io.streams.TextWriter to accept output streams or I/O channels
  as its constructor argument, and io.streams.TextReader to accept input
  streams, strings or I/O channels as their constructor arguments.
  (@thekid)
* Merged xp-framework/core#77: Text reader iteration
  (@thekid)

## 6.2.4 / 2015-05-23

### Heads up!

* Deprecated XPI (XP Installer). Use Composer or Glue instead.
  (@thekid)

### Features

* Merged xp-framework/core#75: Support for new `unittest -w` command line.
  See https://github.com/xp-framework/xp-runners/releases/tag/v5.3.0
  (@thekid)
* Made `unittest -e` consistent with `xp -e`: Add ability to omit trailing
  semicolon, support leading opening PHP tag, code piped via stdin.
  (@thekid)

## 6.2.3 / 2015-05-18

### Heads up!

* Deprecated RandomCodeGenerator and RandomPasswordGenerator classes from
  the security.password package
  (@thekid)
* Deprecated io.sys.StdStream class, superseded by io.streams API
  (@thekid)
* Deprecated `text.format` and `text.parser` APIs.
  (@thekid)
* Deprecated io.SearchableStream class, superseded by text.Tokenizer API
  (@thekid)
* Deprecated security.Policy class and API
  (@thekid)

### Features

* Made ResourceProvider useable via `new import("lang.ResourceProvider")`.
  This way, you don't need to force its loading by adding e.g. a call to
  XPClass::forName() to the static initializer / constructor / etcetera.
  (@thekid)
* Made typeof() behave consistent with reflection on callable type hint.
  (@thekid)
* Made util.log.LogCategory's first parameter optional, using "default"
  as identifier if omitted.
  (@thekid)

### Bugfixes

* Fixed `is()` to support function types correctly
  (@thekid)
* Fixed `Objects::hashOf()` raising an exception when invoked w/ functions
  (@thekid)
* Fixed `xp::stringOf()` producing incorrect indentation for values nested
  inside arrays
  (@thekid)

## 6.2.2 / 2015-05-17

### Bugfixes

* Fixed class detail parsing for function types
  (@thekid)
* Fixed Type::forName() to also work for the `callable` type union.
  (@thekid)
* Fixed issue #74: Ambiguity in function types
  (@thekid)

## 6.2.1 / 2015-05-14

### Features

* Merged xp-framework/core#73: Optimized reflection details for exception
  class being initialized multiple times.
  (@thekid, @kiesel)

## 6.2.0 / 2015-05-05

### Heads up!

* Changed `lang.XPClass` to load the reflection instance lazily. This way,
  we can defer class loading until we actually access a details requiring
  the reflection instance; and thus speed up iterating a packages' classes,
  for instance.
  (@thekid)
* Deprecated `null()` core functionality and rewrote codebase to do
  without it. See pull request xp-framework/core#70
  (@thekid)
* Deprecated `delete()` core functionality - use the `unset` language
  construct instead. See pull request xp-framework/core#69
  (@thekid)

### Features

* Merged xp-framework/core#71: Unicode unittest icons - @thekid

## 6.1.1 / 2015-04-25

### Bugfixes

* Fixed thrown exceptions not appearing in `xp -r` output for interface
  (@thekid)

### Features

* Replaced all occurrences of `create_function()` with real closures
  (@thekid)
* Added support for `/** @type [type] */` for fields.
  (@thekid)

## 6.1.0 / 2015-04-06

### Heads up!

* Deprecated uses() core functionality - use the `use` statement and PHP's
  namespaces instead. This also deprecates classes in the global namespace
  and the "package"-classes introduced in xp-framework/rfc#37.
  (@thekid)
* Deprecated raise() core functionality - use the `throw` statement
  instead, it also uses lazy classloading for namespaced classes.
  (@thekid)
* Removed deprecated support for "mixed", "char", "*", "array<T>" and
  "array<string, string>"' in Type::forName(), see xp-framework/core#64
  (@thekid)
* Removed peer.server.Server::addListener() and related classes which had
  been deprecated since August 2006. See pull request xp-framework/core#63
  (@thekid)
* Deprecated `lang.ClassLoader::defineType(string, string, var)` usage.
  Its second parameter now expects a map containing "kind" (either "class",
  "trait" or "interface"), "extends", "implements" and "use" (arrays of
  type references - either XPClass instances or strings).
  (@thekid)

### RFCs

* Implemented relevant part of xp-framework/rfc#298: The `getClassName()`
  method is now deprecated. Rewrite code to use `nameof($this)`.
  (@thekid)
* Implemented xp-framework/rfc#292: Create anonymous instances from traits
  with `newinstance()`. See pull request xp-framework/core#60
  (@thekid)

### Features

* Added support for `/** @var [type] */` for fields.
  http://www.phpdoc.org/docs/latest/references/phpdoc/tags/var.html
  (@thekid)
* Added `lang.XPClass::isTrait()` and `lang.XPClass::getTraits()` methods.
  (@thekid)

* Fixed GzDecompressingInputStream not supporting gzip data with embedded
  original filenames - @thekid

## 6.0.0 / 2015-02-08

### Heads up!

* Added experimental support [HHVM](http://hhvm.com/) support. The version
  tested successfully while writing this is 3.6.0-dev. See xp-framework/core#56
  (@thekid)
* Added PHP 7.0 forward compatibility for the Catchable "Call to a member 
  function" [functionality](https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/847)
  and throw a `NullPointerException`.
  (@thekid)
* Made xp-framework available [via Composer](https://packagist.org/packages/xp-framework/core)
  (@thekid)
* Refactor fatal error handling, see xp-framework/core#30 - (@thekid)

  `assertNotEmpty()`, `assertClass()` and `assertSubclass()` methods from
  unittest.TestCase - (@thekid)
* Changed xp::ENCODING to 'utf-8', all strings are now per default to be
  regarded as containing this charset except where explicitely stated
  otherwise! - (@thekid)
* Classes are now only referenceable by their namespaced names except
  for those in the `lang` package (and subpackages thereof) - (@thekid)
* Removed support for `__generic` style generics which have been deprecated
  since the implementation of RFC #193 - (@thekid)
